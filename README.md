# Data Warehouse & Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository!  


This project is based on a tutorial I used to learn the fundamentals of data warehousing and analytics. While the dataset and core structure come from the tutorial, I rebuilt the SQL scripts myself and created my own version of the data catalog, documentation, and validation checks. These additions highlight my ability not only to learn from industry resources but also to explain and present the concepts independently in SQL.


## Project Requirements

## Credits
This project builds on the tutorial "[SQL Data Warehouse from Scratch](https://youtu.be/9GVqKuTVANE?si=b8bYYZjKV37EPMxt)" by Baraa Khatib Salkini.  The dataset and initial structure come from the tutorial, but I extended the work with custom SQL queries, documentation, and analysis.
